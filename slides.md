# I cannot teach you R! What then?

- A **basic understanding** of what R is
- An **overview** of R capabilities and its syntax
- **Practical usage** of R to analyze crop model output

---

# What is R?

- Programming language and environment for **statistical** computing
- Provides **wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques**

---

# Why should I use it?

- GNU project, **free and open-source**
  - Large community of professionals and enthusiasts, *huge support*
    (R-Bloggers, Stack Overflow, free books)
  - Multiplatform, *runs on any major operating system*
- Supports **procedural programming** with functions `function()`
- **Interpreted** language; accessed through a command-line interpreter. 

```R
> 2 + 2
4
```

---

# What can R do?

- Integrated environment for **data manipulation, calculation and graphical display**
  - *Data handling* and storage, *database* operations (big data anyone?)
  - Easy *operations on array, matrices and data tables*
  - *Graphical tools* for any data-centric purpose
  - *Simple and effective programming language*, highly extensible, can be coupled
    with compiled languages (like C or C++) for computationally intensive tasks.

---

# HUGE repository of packages

- Packages are bits (or very large, too!) of **reusable code to perform any sort
  of task**
- Within the CRAN there are over 18000 packages for:
  - Literally **any type of statistical analysis** (linear and nonlinear modelling,
    statistical test, time-series analysis, clustering, machine learning,
    nerural networks, ...) -â€º Vignettes and CRAN Tasks! 
  - **Graphical representations **(publication-quality plots or digital version).
  - **Fully reproducible high quality documents**, reports or presentations (you can
    embed code to generate plots and tables too), supporting dozen of output
    formats like PDF, MS Word, or even HTML.
  - Capabilities for producing **Web Apps and Dashboards**
  - MORE!

---

# Why not use R?

- A bit of a learning curve (simple language, though!)
- Painfully slow compared to other languages (supports distributed computing,
  though!)
